        <h4>About</h4>
        <p >Marvin has +3 years of Graphic Design experience, where he has learned to think creatively
           in order to conceptualize and execute design concepts. He has become skilled in Web Design
           and Adobe Creative Suite Software. He also has experience in working with traditional
           materials, such as ink and charcoal.
        </p>
        <p>Before his career in Graphic Design, Marvin studied to become an audio engineer as he had
            the desire to create music. He pursued this goal by gaining experience from learning how
            to play several instruments and also working with music mixing software such as Pro Tools.
            Aside from Graphic Design, Marvin has studied several languages, likes to create music,
            and enjoys reading on his free time.
